									            <p>*Limited time 3% Cooperative Broker Standard Commission valid on qualified Taylor Morrison Houston-area homes only. For eligibility, Broker/Agent’s properly registered client (other than Broker/Agent) must enter into a new cash or financed purchase agreement for a new To-Be-Built or Inventory home (each, an “Eligible Home”) written as of 1/1/23-12/31/23 (the “Commission Period”). Commission above not available outside the Promotion Period, at any other Taylor Morrison division or to any party not meeting the Broker Agreement’s eligibility requirements. Any modification of the Broker Commission is in Seller’s sole discretion. All decisions by Seller are final. 3% Cooperative Broker Standard Commission will be calculated using the Base Price on all Eligible Homes, as reflected in the paragraph of the Purchase Agreement entitled “Purchase Price” as of the Purchase Agreement Date (“Commission”). However, if the final purchase price of a To-Be-Built home set forth in the closing disclosure or settlement statement is less than the Base Price of the home as of the Purchase Agreement Date, then the Commission shall be based upon the final purchase price of the home in the closing disclosure or settlement statement.

All other terms and conditions of Taylor Morrison’s Houston Division’s Broker Referral Policies & Procedures (per community) and Broker Bonus Addendum (as applicable) shall apply to the above.
